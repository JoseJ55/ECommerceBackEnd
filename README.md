# ECommerence Backend

## Description 
A backend application that simulates a store database where products can be
stored and orginized by catigory and tags. The application utilizes node.js and
express routes to function by giving data and accepting data. The data is
saved in a MySQL database where it can be updated and deleted. 

The applicationis mainly based on a backend part of a web application so there
isn't a frontend, the main way to interact through the application is through
software that interacts with api like Insomnia or Postman which allow the user to
view the data update and delete data from database. Plans for the future add a
frontend to interact with backend just for the basic information.

## Usage 
To Currently use the application the user will need to cppy using github's ssh
link to a directory and then open directory. Once the application is installed
the user will need to install dependencies by using "npm install". 

Next, the user will need to use the terminal and start the application by typing
"node server.js". The terminal will then respond with "App listening on port
3001!" which the user is able to use Insomnia or Postman to acess data and change or
delete data. The user is able to add products to a category and a tag to add
them to database. The user is able to also add a new category and tag with the
same way. The user is also able to update and delete data.
